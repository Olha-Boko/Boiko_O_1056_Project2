						<div>
						<p>
							The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a trout and species of salmonid native 
							to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. The 
							steelhead (sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run) form of 
							the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. 
							gairdneri) that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three 
							years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great 
							Lakes and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead. </p>

						<p>	Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb (0.5 and 2.3 
							kg), while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach 20 lb (9 kg). Coloration 
							varies widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by 
							a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most 
							vivid in breeding males.</p>

						<p>	The scientific name of the rainbow trout is Oncorhynchus mykiss. The species was 
							originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum 
							in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. 
							Walbaum's original species name, mykiss, was derived from the local Kamchatkan 
							name used for the fish, mykizha. The name of the genus is from the Greek onkos 
							("hook") and rynchos ("nose"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the 
							mating season (the "kype").
